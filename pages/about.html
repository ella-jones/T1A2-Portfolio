                <h3>Who I am.</h3>
                <p class="who-am-i">
                    Hi, I'm Ella Jones. I have always been drawn towards the arts and have found myself constantly
                    following creative passions. Some of my hobbies including; dancing, acting, swimming, drawing,
                    writing and hanging out with my dog/best friend Wally!
                </p>

                <h3>Study and Work Experience.</h3>
                <p class="who-am-i">
                    I am currently studying a diploma of Information Technology at the Coding Academy, with the hopes to
                    start my career as a full-stack web-developer. Coding and web-development is not a new passion of
                    mine and is something that I have loved doing and learning about since I was just a kid. So much so
                    in fact that in my graduating year of high school, I was the top student for ATAR Applied
                    Information Technology in Western Australia! This passion of mine was pushed aside once I left
                    school, in order to follow other passions of mine, however, I am now getting back into it! </p>

                <p class="who-am-i">
                    Previously, I was studying a Bachelor of Creative Arts, majoring in Screen Arts at Curtin
                    University, where I had received a scholarship of excellence. I am currently the studio co-ordinator
                    and head administrator at Ali Roberts Studio, where I organise and plan events, maintain and update
                    the business website, and much more! </p>

                <p class="who-am-i">
                    For a full breakdown of my study and work experice, please see my resumé below.
                </p>
